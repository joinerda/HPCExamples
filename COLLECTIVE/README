Files are designed as examples of how to implement the
most common collective communications in MPI.

MPI_Bcast broadcasts information out to all processes from one.

Reduce reduces a variable with an operation (sum, max, logical and,
  etc.) across processes.

Scatter splits a large array into chunks on individual processes.

Gather collects chunks on individual processes onto a single
   large array on one process.

"Cheesy_reduce" is an alternative to gathering which uses Reduce
   on a sparesly populated array. Not as efficient as a proper
   scatter/gather, but easy to implement.

scattergatherv shows the use of scatterv and gatherv to
   implement scatter and gather on chunks that don't
   evenly split across the number of processes.
