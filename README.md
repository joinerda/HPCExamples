# HPCExamples
Example codes to demonstrate HPC principles

The WAVE_COMP module has examples of solving the wave equation in 1-D through a finite difference approach using Euler's method, solved using a variety of different languages. The purpose of the module is to allow students to compare and benchmark language choice and its imapact on time to science using an easy to describe and read, mostly memory coherent application.
